    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the most popular techniques for implementing large language models (LLMs) and offers an easy win for companies looking to get on board with the latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI). However, apart from productivity tools like chatbots and Q&A services, RAG has struggled to provide any use cases that drive value in the same way as traditional machine learning and natural language processing. While Q&A services do improve companies' efficiency by putting more information at the fingertips of their employees, the value can be hard to quantify.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I offer a RAG-powered solution that drives value in a more direct and measurable way, by acting as a zero-shot multi-label classifier."

    "### Overview of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) <a class='anchor' id='rag'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is, at its core, just a bit of clever prompting where you ask a question of an LLM while simultaneously providing the LLM with the information it needs to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine handing a person a history textbook and asking them \"What year was George Washington born?\" The person would be able to look the answer up in the textbook, and this task would be even easier for them if we only provided them with the chunks of text from the book that spoke about George Washington. This is exactly what a RAG system does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of RAG is creating a knowledge bank, or vector store. In the context of the example above, this would be taking the history book and creating a searchable database from its text. This is acheived by taking chunks of the text, vectorizing the chunks with the encoding side of a transformer model, and storing the embeddings in a vector database, where records can be retrieved based on vector similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, when a user asks a question about the source material, the question is embedded using the same model used to embed the source material, and a similarity search is executed against the knowledge bank, retrieving the chunks of text that pertain to the question that's being asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question, along with the context retrieved from the knowledge bank, are then sent to an LLM, which responds with the answer to the question based on the provided context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG as a Document Classifier <a class='anchor' id='rag-classifier'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular uses of RAG within industry is providing users with a way of engaging with largs repositories of text information: think along the lines of providing employees with the ability to ask questions about HR documents, benefits, or standard operating procedures. You could also envision legal departments being able to engage with long and complex documents. Typically, knowledge banks would be composed of corpi of many documents, allowing answers to be compiled from diverse sets of sources, but by creating smaller knowledge banks from single documents and asking specific and intentional questions, one could transform RAG into a robust zero-shot classifier model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a simple classification use case where you want to simply classify a book as \"Romance\" or \"Sci-Fi.\" You could create a knowledge bank from the book, and then ask a prompt like, \"Which genre best applies to this book: Romance or Sci-Fi?\" Now this wouldn't be the best use of LLM resources, since this could easily be done with classical ML (or even just looking at the cover of the book). But now imagine you have a set of questions that require more knowledge of the book's text: Is there a plot twist? Is it appropriate for teens? Does it contain any illicit themes? Questions like these would require one to spend hours fully reading the book to ascertain the answers, but a RAG application could answer them in less than a minute (probably).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine a simlilar use case applied to a company's contracts. Does the contract contain a lease agreement? Is the payment structure based on progress milestones or a payment dates? Does it contain any rebates or warrantees? These are questions a legal associate could spend a significant amount of time trying to answer by reading and searching through the contract. Using RAG to address such a use case could reduce this time to essentially nothing. And with RAG systems' ability to provide the sources from which answers were obtained, the legal analyst would have the ability to double-check any answer the LLM provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these questions could be framed as a binary classification problem solvable, zero-shot, using RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Data <a class='anchor' id='about-data'></a>\n",

    "This approach to RAG -- using it as a vehicle for accomplishing complex classification tasks on large documents or corpi -- would provide business with value adds similar to the savings produced by classical ML, but the development time to produce these savings are drastically lessened. Rather than months of feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and training, and AI engineer could very quickly spin up a RAG-based zero-shot model that would produce reliable results without much effort. This is where I see a lot of savings from AI coming from in future.\n",

    "In follow-up projects, I'd like to examine cross-contamination of source materials from creating larger vector stores and trying to classify documents within the store, rather than creating a new vector store for each document. This could produce significant time savings, and would be worth comparison to the parallel creation of vectore stores for individual documents.\n",
